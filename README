FogBugz Useful Quick Input Greasemonkey Script
---
This script makes the quick entry actually useful by letting you modify several options
including:

* Category
* Who to assign it to
* Time estimate
* Due Date
* Priority

This should also save the last entered as the default in a cookie...

FogBugz Spreadsheet
---
This tool will export and import from a CSV to allow bulk editing of cases.




FogBugz: MakeItBetter
===
There are lots of things I wish were better about FogBugz - also, the API is clunky and unpleasant.  That being said, I don't see myself writing a better task tracking system anytime soon and it's the only one I know that does good effort tracking, so...

- Why is the quick entry field so useless? (auto assigns to first category/user, no
  ability for time estimates or any other field)
- Why can't I do bulk entry?
- Why is the API so complex/bad? - It's pretty much impossible to create a case without
  doing a half-dozen calls to try to get ID's for users, categories, types, etc...
- Why doesn't the New Case screen remember your last selected fields and default to them?
- Why does a case detail have an additional edit screen?  Let me edit from the same page  if I have permissions
